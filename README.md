# NLP-using-Python
Processing of natural langauge using Python 

Overview of the Project The "Natural Language Processing in Python Tutorial" is a comprehensive guide designed to introduce users to various NLP techniques using Python. The project focuses on analyzing stand-up comedians' transcripts to demonstrate practical applications of NLP. It comprises a series of Jupyter Notebooks, each dedicated to a specific aspect of NLP, facilitating hands-on learning and exploration.

Project Structure and Content Jupyter Notebooks: The tutorial is organized into several notebooks, each focusing on a distinct NLP task:

0-Hello-World.ipynb: Introduction to the tutorial and setup instructions. 1-Data-Cleaning.ipynb: Techniques for cleaning and preprocessing text data. 2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis.ipynb: Methods for analyzing and visualizing text data. 3-Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb: Implementing sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone of text. 4-Topic-Modeling.ipynb: Uncovering hidden topics within a collection of documents. 5-Text-Generation.ipynb: Generating new text based on existing data using language models. Data: The project includes a transcripts directory containing text files of various stand-up comedians' performances. These serve as the primary dataset for analysis throughout the tutorial.

Additional Resources: A notes.md file is provided, offering supplementary information, including Jupyter Notebook shortcuts, web scraping tips, and regular expressions guidance.

Setup and Installation Prerequisites: To effectively engage with the tutorial, users are advised to install Anaconda, which includes Jupyter Notebook and essential data science libraries. The recommended version is Python 3.7.
Steps:

Download Anaconda: Anaconda Python 3.7

Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone the project repository:

bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/adashofdata/nlp-in-python-tutorial.git Alternatively, download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it to a preferred location.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Windows: Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook. Mac/Linux: Open a terminal and execute: nginx Copy Edit jupyter notebook Open the Notebooks: Navigate to the project directory within Jupyter and open 0-Hello-World.ipynb to begin.

Additional Packages: Some notebooks may require extra libraries such as wordcloud, textblob, and gensim. Install them using pip or conda as needed.

Detailed Breakdown of Notebooks

Data Cleaning (1-Data-Cleaning.ipynb):

Objective: Prepare raw text data for analysis by removing inconsistencies and standardizing formats. Techniques: Removing punctuation and special characters. Converting text to lowercase. Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens. Removing stop words: Eliminating common words that may not carry significant meaning (e.g., "and", "the", "is"). Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms.

Exploratory Data Analysis (2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis.ipynb):
Objective: Gain insights into the dataset through visualization and statistical measures. Techniques: Word frequency analysis: Identifying the most common words or phrases. Word clouds: Visual representations of word frequency. Distribution plots: Understanding the spread and central tendencies of word counts and sentence lengths.

Sentiment Analysis (3-Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb):
Objective: Determine the sentiment or emotional tone of the text data. Techniques: Using pre-trained models from libraries like TextBlob to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. Visualizing sentiment distribution across different comedians to compare their styles.

Topic Modeling (4-Topic-Modeling.ipynb):
Objective: Identify underlying topics present in the text corpus. Techniques: Implementing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover topics. Analyzing the composition of topics across different comedians' transcripts.

Text Generation (5-Text-Generation.ipynb):
Objective: Generate new text sequences that mimic the style of the input data. Techniques: Building and training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to produce text. Experimenting with model parameters to improve the quality and coherence of generated text.
